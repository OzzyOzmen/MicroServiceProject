# MicroServiceProject
This is an example of MicroService for getting idea and for education. Also i will update it day by day, so repository is still continuing.

Also dont forget to download ffmpeg file from https://mega.nz/file/GAdFCRzZ#dQC8qK5e1aN2uSDg-RVHv0i1SxXKYYqPMe46WOtaMT4  and then add this file into 
the Services/UserApi/File  folder...

Next steps ( Road Map ) : 
1- Adding more comment lines to the project to make it more understandable.
2- Unit Tests for event bus.
3- Binding the APIs and Eventbus project.
4- Configuring API Gateway. 
5- Creating Docker file..
